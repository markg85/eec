1. Deeply integrate Dwoo in the Core. Each module should have it's own Dwoo_Data object (and can be disabled when registering the module)
2. Each module CAN have a own template page but is not required
3. Configuration things should be handled in the core, like setting where Dwoo should look for templated. In time this can be used for more things as well.
4. Modules should somehow be able to pipe other modules. Example: /news/1 is just the first news message but /rest/news/1 should also be the first 
   news message only in a API like way where the news is outputted as XML-RPC, json or a self made XML format. So here the rest module should load
   the news module and the news module should be aware that rest loaded it to follow a different code path to make api output possible.
